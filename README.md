# ⚔️ Math Combat Game
A two-player terminal-based math battle game built using Python.

## 📌 Project Description
Math Combat Game is a Python-based terminal game where two players compete by solving timed math problems.  
Correct answers deal full damage, while partially correct answers deal proportional damage.  
The game continues until one player’s health points reach zero, combining speed, accuracy, and strategy.

## 🚀 Features
- Two-player turn-based gameplay  
- Timed math problem solving  
- Critical and proportional damage based on accuracy  
- Real-time health tracking  
- Menu-driven terminal interface  

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
- Python functions  
- Random module  
- Loops and conditional statements  
- User input handling with timeout  
- Accuracy-based calculations  

## 💾 Data Storage
Player health points and math problem outcomes are stored temporarily in memory during gameplay.  
No external files are used; all game state exists during program execution.

## 📌 Learning Outcomes
- Practicing real-time user input handling  
- Applying accuracy calculations to game mechanics  
- Implementing turn-based game logic  
- Using Python for interactive terminal games  
- Combining math, randomness, and control flow in gameplay
